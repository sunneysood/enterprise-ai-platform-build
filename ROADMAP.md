## Cross-Cutting Tracks

These threads run through the day blocks above. They do not add days; they set a minimum bar every project must meet.

| Thread | Introduced | Applied in | Minimum evidence per project |
|---|---|---|---|
| API design & contracts                                     | Days 011–035 (P1)          | Every project                                      | OpenAPI contract, versioning note, completed `api-design/api-design-checklist.md` |
| Containers & CI/CD                                         | Days 011–035 (P1 skeleton) | Every project                                      | Dockerfile and a CI run that executes the tests                                   |
| Security & threat modeling                                 | Days 011–035               | Every project; deepened in Days 073–080            | One threat-model entry and one authorization test                                 |
| Observability                                              | Days 011–035 (P1)          | Every project; distributed tracing in Days 081–090 | Structured logs, metrics, and a request-ID or trace path                          |
| Evaluation                                                 | Days 046–055 (P2)          | Every AI project; formalized in Days 073–080       | A small labelled evaluation set that reruns on every change                       |
| Cost / FinOps                                              | Days 046–055               | Every AI project; consolidated in Days 091–100     | A cost-per-request estimate                                                       |

| P5 Customer Data Onboarding      | Starts Days 036–045, finishes Days 066–072    | Ingestion, validation and reconciliation overlap the Data & Messaging block                                                         |
| P6 Operations AI                 | Days 056–065                                  | Event-triggered extension of P3. Reuses Kafka from Days 011–035. Adds an approval and remediation loop rather than a separate build |
| P7 Production LLM Serving        | Days 081–090                                  |                                                                                                                                     |
| P8 Flagship Platform             | Starts Days 046–055, hardened in Days 091–100 | Merge each project into the platform as it finishes, so Days 091–100 are hardening, not first integration                           |

## Compute and Budget

GPU spending cap: **USD 50 maximum in total** for the whole journey. P7 (Days 081–090) is the main consumer.
The detailed plan (provider, instance type, hours) is a future task, to be done before Day 081.
Fallbacks if the cap is tight: run a small model on CPU, rent a GPU only for benchmark sessions, and stop instances after every session.

---

## Resource Policy

Resources are categorized as:

- **Core** — directly used in the current phase
- **Reference** — consulted when a specific gap appears
- **Optional** — useful but not required

Add a resource only when the roadmap calls for it or the current implementation exposes a real gap, and only if it provides one of: a missing mental model, a stronger implementation technique, a production case study, or a new architectural capability.

## Success Criteria

By Day 100, the repository should contain:

- meaningful working code
- architecture diagrams
- ADRs
- API contracts
- security decisions
- evaluation suites
- reliability experiments
- performance measurements
- cost assumptions
- production-readiness thinking
- a clear path into the flagship platform
